	<p><b>Follow these steps to ensure the perfect promposal!</b></p>
	<ol>
  <li>Find out who you want to ask. Make sure to do this early before they are asked.</li>
  <li>Think of a creative promposal. Try to incorporate the person who you're asking's interests.  Think of what sports they play, what music they like, or any other of their other hobbies!</li>
  <li>Get materials. If you're using a poster, decide what color and decorations you want to use to decorate it. Plan what your poster will say. Try to make it punny and cute! For example, if the person you are asking plays lacrosse, you could write "<i>LAX</i> go to prom!</li>
  <li>Enlist the help of your friends!  Tell your friends about your promposal and make a plan for surprising the person you are asking. Your friends could help in guiding the person you're asking to you and they could also hold the poster for you.</li>
  <li>Figure out a date to do your promposal.</li>
  <li>Ask the person to prom!</li>
